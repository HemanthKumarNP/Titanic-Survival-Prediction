# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

### Overview

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. In this project, we use the Titanic dataset, which provides information about the passengers onboard, such as their age, sex, class, and whether they survived or not. We aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the survival outcome for new passengers.
